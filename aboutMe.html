		<p class="aboutMePara">Hi there! I'm a music-loving, pun-making Milennial girl who graduated with an engineering undergrad degree and decided it was too boring to pursue as a career. Having worked in the SEO & content marketing side of things for a start up in India, I got my hands on a unique UI-UX project that piqued my interest. </p>

		<p class="aboutMePara">It helped me realize that even though I'd steered far away from my technical base, there was a way for me to get back to it and actually enjoy it! Hence, my decision of pursuing my masters in Interactive Digital Media. I hope to graduate and pursue a career in front-end development and UI/UX design.</p>
